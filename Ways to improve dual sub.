hello i don't know how to use this site yet adn i am looking up instructions getting lost in traffic instead so i found this line of inquiry and would like to suggest you put in pinyin into dual sub for mandarin and simplified chinese as sometimes pronunciation is the problem. i need it verify what i am reading and would like a button on screen to turn it off and on so that i have a choice to use it and then click to see the pinyin and let go to make it go away again and i believe this will improve my ability to read character. which man i really need. i literally suck at chinese so please can you set me up with this one little piece. i can share some stuff with you if you can draw.  just email me or fork whatever but i am learning code and am making a cloning jig for games. there are tutorials that a c coder can use on game maker studio 2 to do the same but if interested i can show a partial completed one in google drive that i made. anyways i am learning four language and code in two different ways right now and i am really busy please fork or email as desired.
stephengivens45@yahoo.com is my email.
